99 Bottles of Beer exercise - My take...

Same exercise but written respectively in [D](https://dlang.org/), [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi), [Go](https://go.dev/), [$\\LaTeX\$](https://www.latex-project.org), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [V](https://vlang.io/) and [Zig](https://ziglang.org/).


### Disclaimer

The zig version is too  _convoluted_ because of my poor proficiency of the new but promising language (it's on my radar ❤️❤️❤️) which moreover by design doesn't even have a `String` type... It does well the job anyway. Sorry!
